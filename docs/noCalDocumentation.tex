\section{Introduction}
Nocal is python-based nonlocal pre/post processing software for nonlocal analysis of finite element analysis results. 
\section{Input Deck}
Nocal is controlled by a python dictionary where all the user inputs (i.e., \emph{cards}) are stored. This file must be called \inputDeckName. Each subsection describes a different card and the data type of each input is shown in italics next to the card
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{deckName}
\emph{String} \\
If the user chooses to build the connectivity matrix from an Abaqus input deck, this is the name of the deck minus the .inp.\\
Example:\\
For an abaqus input deck named paraFipMesh\_11.inp \\
{$\tt{'deckName' : 'paraFipMesh\_11'}$}\\
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item createAllNlElsetsInRegionParaNConf.py,
  \item getElemCent.py,
  \item nonlocalFIP.py,
  \item nonlocalFIPWeight.py
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{dx}
\emph{Float} \\
The is the length of an edge of square nonlocal volume, for spherical nonconformal volumes Nocal will convert this value into a sphere with an equivalent volume to the cube with edges $dx$ \\
Example:\\
For $\Delta x = 0.215443469$ \\
$\tt{'dx' : 0.215443469}$
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item createAllNlElsetsInRegionParaNConf.py,
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{numProc}
\emph{Integer} \\
Number of processors to use when preprocessing nonlocal volumes \\
Example:\\
If you wanted to use 4 processors \\
$\tt{'numProc' : 4}$
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item createAllNlElsetsInRegionParaNConf.py,
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{isWeight}
\emph{boolean} \\
True if you want a weighted average over the nonlocal volume; False if you want a standard mean \\
The weighted average for a value $\Gamma$ is given by
%%%
%%%
\begin{equation}
\Gamma^{\textrm{nl}}(\pmb{x})  = \frac{1}{A(\pmb{x})}
\int_{\Omega}\phi(\pmb{x} - \pmb{y}) 
\Gamma^{\textrm{loc}}(\pmb{y}) d\Omega,
\label{eq:fipnl}
\end{equation}
%%%
%%%
where $\Gamma^{\textrm{loc}}$ and $\Gamma^{\textrm{nl}}$ are the local and nonlocal values of some finite element output $\Gamma$ respectively. The position where the nonlocal $\Gamma$ is calculated is $\pmb{x}$ and $\pmb{y}$ is positions around $\pmb{x}$ over which $\Gamma^{\textrm{loc}}$  is integrated. The nonlocal volume is $\Omega$, and  $\phi$ is a Gaussian distributed weighting function. The normalizing value of $A$ is given by 
%%%
%%%
\begin{equation}
A(\pmb{x}) = 
\int_{\Omega}\phi(\pmb{x} - \pmb{y}) 
 d\Omega,
\label{eq:a}
\end{equation}
%%%
%%%
and 
\begin{equation}
\phi(\pmb{x}) = 
\exp{(-||\pmb{x}||^2/l^2}),
\label{eq:phi}
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the nonlocal length scale.\\
Example:\\
if you want a weighted average \\
$\tt{'isWeight' : True}$
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item runNonlocalFip.py
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{resultsFileName}
\emph{String} \\
This is the name of the results file where you want to postprocess over the predetermined nonlocal values, you should include the extention (although what extension it is does not matter)\\
Example:\\
For a results file named paraFipMesh-FIP\_1\_11.txt\\
{$\tt{'resultsFileName' : 'paraFipMesh-FIP\_1\_11.txt'}$}\\
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item nonlocalFIP.py,
  \item nonlocalFIPWeight.py
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{L}
\emph{Float} \\
Length scale $l$ for \Eq \ref{eq:phi}, It is only used if isWeight=True\\
Example:\\
You want to weight over a region of $l=0.13365046175$
{$\tt{'L' : 0.13365046175}$}\\
Module Location\\
\begin{itemize}
  \item nonlocalFIPWeight.py
\end{itemize}

\section{Running Nocal}
If all finite element input decks and all results files are in ./data (or .$\backslash$data) then run from your command line\\
{\tt{python \mainFileName}} \\
The results of any postprocessing are stored in ./results (or .$\backslash$results)
